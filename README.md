## Notes

I started the day by writing down a list of what I will need to have in the application before building out my component tree. For example, "Main page will display list of kegs. Each keg will include name, brewery, price, abv, and ibu."

I thought that I had my component structure all figured out, but the further I got into my project I wanted to go a different direction than what I had started with. I went with five children (add, edit, header, 404, and keg list) with one "grandchild"(keg), but the next go around I plan on doing something different with the edit feature. Right now, it is routing to it's own module. This doesn't really make sense or is helpful to the user having it route this way.

As far as how this felt compared to Angular.. I miss Angular. Everything just feels pretty messy to me with this, especially with the styling. I'm sure as things progress and I start to get a better handle on things that will change.
